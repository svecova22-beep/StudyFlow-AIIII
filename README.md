# StudyFlow-AIIII

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

StudyFlow AI is a smart scheduling tool that helps students manage study time effectively. It uses AI to recommend what to study next, predict time needed per topic, and create personalized weekly plans. By analyzing past performance and deadlines, it reduces procrastination and boosts productivity.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1: Inefficient time allocation – Students often study randomly rather than focusing on weak areas, wasting valuable time.
* problem 2: Procrastination and deadline overload – Without a smart schedule, students delay studying until deadlines stack up, increasing stress.


## How is it used?

A student starts by entering their subjects, deadlines, and past grades. The system then creates a personalized study schedule by comparing their data with similar learners and predicting the time needed for each topic. The student follows the daily plan, logs their progress, and the schedule adapts based on their actual performance—focusing more on weaker areas and adjusting timelines as needed.

It’s designed for busy study periods like exam weeks or project deadlines, and is aimed at students at any level who need help managing their time effectively. The tool prioritizes privacy, flexibility for different schedules, and a simple interface that encourages consistent use without adding extra stress. ![Student studying with a planner](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1434030216411-0b793f4b4173?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=80) 

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
